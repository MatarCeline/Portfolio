Web Scraping Project:

The purpose of this code is to scrape all relevant information from the Freeglisse website, specifically focusing on the page dedicated to second-hand skis: https://freeglisse.com/fr/12-ski-occasion.

The goal of scraping this page is to analyze the types of products sold on the platform, as well as the price ranges applied according to product quality. This will help determine whether my client should consider adding this website's offerings to his online marketplace and assess if the products sold are a good fit for his target market.
